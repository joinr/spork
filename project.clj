  :description
  "A set of libraries derived from Spoon's Operations Research Kit.
   Libraries are modular and will be supported as stand-alone dependencies.
   This project is an uberjar that includes all of the modular bits in a single
   jar, for easier dependencies.  spork is purpose-built to be clojure-centric,
   focusing on a functional API, a default towards purity and persistent data
   structures, with alternative mutable/imperative counterparts.  The vast
   majority of spork is written in Clojure, with an intentional nod toward
   independence from external libraries, particularly Java libs.  Consequently,
   spork should provide a lightweight, clojure-based platform for the topics
   covered by the libraries.  I am currently working to eliminate legacy
   java dependencies where possible."
