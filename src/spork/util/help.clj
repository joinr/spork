   "Functional programming is built on something called the Lambda Calculus."

   "  Functions are the primary building blocks for Clojure programs."
   "Named functions can be defined using defn:"
   "  (defn myfunc [msg] (println msg))"
   "One feature of functional programming is the use of lambda functions."
   "  Lambda functions are akin to anonymous functions"
   "  They are practically useful because we can inline function definitions."
   "  This allows a very flexible programming style."
   "Clojure provides 2 ways of producing these lambda functions:"
   "  Use fn, a primitive version of defn, to define anonymous functions:"
   "    (fn [arg] (println (str arg)))"
   "    This looks exactly like defn, except the function has no name."
   "    Thus, no symbol refers to the function."
   "  If we prefix # to an expression, we can create one:"
   "    #(println (str %))"
   "     The argument is implied by %.  Multiple arg versions use %1,%2,..."
   "     This is equivalent to our previous example."
   "  We can compose functions...technically creating a new lambda function.."
   "    (comp println str))"
   "  We can also use partial application to fill in arguments..."
   "    (fn [user] (println ((partial apply str :user) user)))"

   "  Clojure's function 'map' takes a function an a sequence of values."

 :expressions
 (help-msg
   "Lisp dialects use parenthesis () to denote lists."
   "Lisp dialects process lists of expressions by by applying the first symbol"
   "to the remaining symbols in the list."
   "Thus, (println 1) is like saying 'return the result of feeding 1 to println'"
   "Primitive values, like numbers and strings, cannot be applied."
   "So the expression (1 2 3) would throw an error."
   "  What is the result of feeding 2 3 to 1?  Doesn't make sense for numbers"

    "that is equivalent to the change.  Operations are pure functions."
    "This allows versions of the structure to persist, and is highly useful."
    "The main structures are:"
    "                       read in-line , created from function"
